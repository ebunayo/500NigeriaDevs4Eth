**500 Nigeria Developers for Ethereum
 Submission for Gitcoin Global Hackathon

The project was a pilot project designed by myself to support the #onemilliondevs announced by Joseph Lubin at Devcon5.
The project is driven by three (3) primary objectives 
*Increase the awareness of Ethereum among developers in Nigeria
*Add 500 developers into the global pool of Ethereum developers under the onemilliondevs project
*Have minimum of a hundred open source relatable use cases added to GitHub
 
 The project as at close of registration has two hundred and seven (207) registered participants who were in two categories of
 those with development experience with other programming language and those with no development experience. 
 The Project attracted nine (9) mentors (five of which are Nigerians and the rest four were non-Nigerians).
 
 So far the project just concluded the third week of learning and the modules taught included Blockchain fundamentals I & II.
 The module content includes
 *introduction to Ethereum
 Ethereum core concepts
 Ethereum Wallets
 Consensus mechanisms
 Ethereum Nodes and client Setup
 Token standards and Introduction to smart contract
 
 From feedback and tasks submission the participants (both with development experience and non-development experience), have learnt a lot, gotten great understanding of ethereum, installed nodes and deployed their first smart contract.
 
 The project has five (5) more modules to cover and has gained some good attention with Consensys Academy issuing special discount for Consensys academy courses to participants who are interested. 
 
 To ensure that participants are at their best a number of incentives and rewards has been in play and will still be introduced. Some incentives that has been used so far includes NFT token rewards, Swags by mentors, distribution of internet data and the introduction of personality profile chat where selected participants can get to chat with Ethereum personalities. 
 
 Good to also mention that one of the participants already got invited into Hyperledger Besu open source channel as contributor.
 
 Considering that it is a pilot project, a number of reviews and evaluation has been done based on the number of weeks already spent and the results are taking into consideration in drafting a more expansive plan to get in more developers into Ethereum ecosystem under the #onemilliondevs program.
